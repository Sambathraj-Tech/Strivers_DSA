Given an array nums of size n which may contain duplicate elements, return a list of pairs
where each pair contains a unique element from the array and its frequency in the array.

You may return the result in any order, but each element must appear exactly once in the output.

def countFrequencies(nums): #[1, 2, 2, 1, 3]
  frequency = {} # empty
  for i in range(0, len(nums)): # (0,4)
      if i in frequency:      #1 in freq = NO , then count 1 in the 4th index of the freq
          frequency[i] += 1
      else:
          frequency[i] = 1
  
  result = []  # emptylist for Output
  for key in frequency:
      value = frequency[key]
      pair  = [key, value]
      result.append(pair) 
  return result
nums = [1, 2, 2, 1, 3]  
print(countFrequencies(nums))
