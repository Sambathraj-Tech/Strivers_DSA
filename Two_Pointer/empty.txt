wo Pointer pattern:

1. Master the Core Variations
Understand the three main types:

Opposite direction (left at start, right at end, move toward each other) - for sorted arrays, palindromes
Same direction (both start at beginning, move at different speeds) - for partitioning, removing duplicates
Fixed distance (maintain constant gap between pointers) - less common but useful
==============================================================================================
2. Build Pattern Recognition:
Train yourself to spot when two pointers work:

Sorted array problems (pair sum, triplets)
Partitioning problems (Dutch National Flag, sort colors)
String manipulation (reverse, palindrome checking)
Removing duplicates from sorted arrays
Container/trapping problems
==============================================================================================
3. Practice Decision-Making
The hardest part is knowing when to move which pointer. Practice asking:

What condition tells me to move the left pointer?
What condition tells me to move the right pointer?
What condition tells me I found a valid answer?
When do I stop?
==============================================================================================
4. Solve Progressively
Start with these classic problems in order:

Beginner:

Two Sum II (sorted array)
Valid Palindrome
Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array
Reverse String

Intermediate:

3Sum
Container With Most Water
Sort Colors (Dutch National Flag)
Trapping Rain Water
Advanced:

4Sum
Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters (transition to sliding window)
==============================================================================================

5. Practice the Mental Model
Before coding, always:

Draw out the array with indices
Simulate pointer movement on paper for 3-4 iterations
Write down the conditions for moving each pointer
Identify edge cases (empty array, single element, all same elements)
==============================================================================================

6. Code Deliberately
Write clean code with clear variable names:

python
left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
while left < right:
    # clear condition checks
    # move pointers based on logic
Avoid rushing. Understanding why you move a pointer is more important than memorizing solutions.
