a = 36
b = 48

# Check the two numbers is greater then 0 and proceed
while (a > 0) and (b > 0): 
    # If A is greater ,then (do % with B) because greatest number is placed before %.
    if (a > b):
        # After modulo the answer will put it in the A
        a = a % b
    else :
        b = b % a  
# If a or b becomes 0 print() the next value of 0   
if a == 0:
    print(b)
else: 
    print(a)

Time Complexity : O(log   (min(a,b)))  -->log  : its always comes when Division is used or %
